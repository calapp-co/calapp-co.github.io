                        <p>It’s amazing what a bit of direction can bring.</p>

                        <p>I am not here to give you tips on how to succeed in business or anything of the sort (all of
                            that would be new information to me!). Instead, in this article I will focus on one thing I
                            do know how to do: live and work with minimal stress.</p>

                        <p>I used to believe work and having people rely on you to complete said work in itself was
                            stressful. Turns out, I am just a serial procrastinator and that’s what made it stressful. I
                            didn’t understand how to use time management to reduce stress and I had a little too much
                            trust in my ability to stay on task...</p>

                        <p>Like many people, I can’t be trusted to do what is best for myself. I can have loads of
                            time-pressured work to do and “accidentally” end up playing FIFA for three hours. As a
                            result, a little bit of artificial discipline is sometimes necessary.</p>

                        <p>This is where time management comes in. Procrastination and poor planning always led to
                            periods of high stress when it was time to really get work done. It’s not rocket science,
                            but I found using my time with more intention was necessary to maintain low stress levels.
                        </p>

                        <p>So how did I get started? Breaking up work into time blocks with definitive beginnings and
                            ends made it far easier to handle mentally. It’s intimidating to approach work with the
                            mindset that you have to do a massive task. Whereas, a set period of three hours of work on
                            a specific task is far easier to digest. And you walk away feeling good that you’ve at least
                            achieved something.</p>

                        <p>Maybe you have no problem attacking a big project. Personally I prefer to break tasks into
                            blocks, that way I make sure I have time for other important things and never get too
                            overwhelmed. I have found I also get tasks done quicker because I approach them tactically,
                            rather than with brute force at the last minute.</p>

                        <p>I am able to do this through scheduling. A well-crafted schedule can be like a personal
                            trainer. It creates a personal commitment that you’ve prepared yourself for mentally and
                            often you’ll find you can push you beyond what you thought you were capable of. Plus, you
                            get that feeling of accomplishment afterwards regardless if you didn’t finish the entire
                            project in one sitting.</p>

                        <p>Not convinced there’s much wrong with living a stressful lifestyle? A bit of stress is good
                            for everyone right? Read on to be slapped in the face with truth.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Work stress is dangerous and unfortunately, normal</h2>

                        <p>Stress is an inevitable part of being an adult and having a job. As an employed person there
                            are expectations you are required to meet and standards to be upheld, which is stressful
                            enough without throwing in the fact that your financial well-being, lifestyle and freedom is
                            almost entirely dependent on your ability to perform.</p>

                        <p>It may seem like everyone you know is stressed, after all, the working life can be intense
                            and the stakes are high. Being stressed has become the norm, and we just accept that.</p>

                        <p>However, there are few ailments currently known to humankind that can cause damage in as many
                            different ways to the human mind and body as stress. According to the almighty WebMD,
                            chronic stress can directly cause mental health problems, cardiovascular disease, eating
                            disorders, menstrual problems, impotence, skin issues, and digestive issues [1]. Jeez.</p>

                        <p>Stress can hurt you everywhere. Don’t you owe it to your future self to try harder to manage
                            it?</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Managing stress through the elimination of multitasking</h2>

                        <p>This brings us to the importance of removing multitasking from your work as much as possible.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Multitasking necessitates stress.</blockquote>

                        <p>In order to use time management to reduce stress, multitasking is the first thing you must
                            stop doing immediately. So close down Facebook in that other tab and come back, I’ll still
                            be waiting.</p>

                        <p>There is neuroscientific evidence that almost no one is capable of multitasking effectively.
                            Yes, even women. A study by the University of Utah analyzed subjects’ ability to do both a
                            single task and two tasks simultaneously. Subjects were asked to perform OSPAN
                            (memory-based) tasks while driving. Only 2.5% of people experienced no hindrance to their
                            driving ability while also completing OSPAN tasks [2].</p>

                        <p>Sounds unproductive right?</p>

                            alt="man texting and driving">
                        <span class="caption text-muted">[Photo by Alexandre Boucher on Unsplash] Tsssk. There’s a
                            reason texting and driving is illegal in most places now.</span>

                        <p>In the work setting, having multiple voices and commitments grappling for your time will
                            eventually become overwhelmingly stressful. You may find yourself having trouble reaching
                            deadlines and delivering sub-par work because your mind isn’t focused. Or you may find
                            yourself taking several daily breaks to cry in the bathroom. Or, constantly listening to
                            loud aggressive metal music to hype you up for the shitstorm of a day you have ahead of you.
                        </p>

                        <p>This compiles stress (or at least raises blood pressure and may damage your hearing). You end
                            up stressed trying to do too many things at once and then become further burdened by poor
                            feedback on the distracted work you produce. This feeling lingers and you may bring this
                            stress home and eventually it seeps into every corner of your life.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bringing work-related stress home</h2>

                        <p>An aspect of having a stress-free work life is the luxury of not having work on your mind
                            when you’re not on the clock. Going home and having the mental space for your family and
                            friends is important for maintaining a fulfilling life.</p>

                        <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block"
                            src="2020-04-11-andrew-newman-calapp-stress-management-article-3-images/4-friends-eating.jpg"

                        <span class="caption text-muted">[Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash]</span>

                        <p>Workplace stress can have a negative impact on life outside of work. The Economic Policy
                            Institute studied the impact of irregular work (either under or over-employed, working
                            inconsistent hours) on stress and work-family conflict. Over a quarter of those studied
                            admitted to experiencing work-family conflict, compared to one in ten people that work
                            regular shifts [3].</p>

                        <p>This is noteworthy because even if you do work a regular shift, stressing about work at home
                            is likely to lead to family conflict and affect others around you.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to use time blocking for time management to reduce stress</h2>

                        <p>Time blocking is a strategy for time management to reduce stress that uses designated time
                            slots for specific activities, in order to keep on task.</p>

                        <p>As former American football player Lou Holtz says, <i>“It’s not the load that breaks you, it’s
                            the way you carry it.”</i> Think of time blocking as my gift to you that can help you lift your
                            load with comfort and carry it as far as you need.</p>

                        <p>Time blocking has become an invaluable tool for many successful people, as it prevents them
                            from time-wasting and helps them accomplish their goals within a set time frame. Proponents
                            of time blocking include Elon Musk and Bill Gates. It seems they have their lives on track
                            right?</p>

                        <p>It makes sense for people in the highest demand for meeting time and multiple ventures under
                            their guidance to schedule their day efficiently. Their time is split, and they need to find
                            a way to prevent their attention from becoming monopolized by a single project or person.
                        </p>

                        <p>However, even if you’re not the CEO of multiple companies, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t, and
                            can’t, work as smart as they do. Implementing clarity and focus into your day has an
                            immeasurable effect on both increasing your productivity and reducing your stress level.</p>

                        <p>Time blocking can be simple, but it requires deliberate planning and great self-awareness.
                            Therefore, it is important to take note of how long certain tasks take and which tasks
                            deserve the most attention. That way you can build a schedule that allocates your time
                            proportionately.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The best way to make sure you are splitting your time effectively
                            is to schedule specific time frames during your day to dedicate yourself completely to your
                            essential tasks.</blockquote>

                        <p>There are other factors to consider such as peak productivity hours and your personal work
                            endurance. To effectively use time management to reduce stress, you must be aware of what
                            times during the day you are most capable of focusing and how long you can maintain that
                            focus.</p>

                        <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block"

                            essential for focus.</span>

                        <p>Personally, I find I am most productive between the hours of 9-12 in the morning, but I am
                            aware that many people get their best work done late at night once most people are asleep.
                            Just be aware of when you work best, that way you can schedule your more meaningful work
                            during these hours and do admin/less intensive work when your mind is not as focused.</p>

                        <p>For example, Charles Darwin would break his day up into short bursts of one particular
                            activity to keep his mind stimulated. He would cycle through periods of exercise, food,
                            creative work, and admin-type activities. He would do each of these at least three times
                            daily. This kept both his body and mind sharp, while simultaneously avoiding burnout on one
                            particular task [4].</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, you have people like Sigmund Freud, who dedicated his entire morning to
                            admin and then his entire afternoon and evening to creative work, with only a break for
                            dinner. This is someone who had great endurance and needed long stretches of time for deep
                            thinking to produce his best work [4].</p>

                        <p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Learn how you work best and empower yourself via time
                            management to reduce stress.</p>

                            never talk to these people…. but let's blame that on COVD-19 social distancing.</span>

                        <p>Routines keep us prepared. When living with a routine, there is never a need to stress about
                            what’s for dinner, because you already planned a meal and bought the ingredients during your
                            weekly Monday night shop. Even if you just bought seven packets of ramen noodles, I won’t
                            judge. At least you won’t go hungry. Also, you always get the exercise you need because
                            you’ve scheduled what days and times you intend to go (because you’re guilty about eating
                            all those noodles).</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">With a little effort and the right calendar app, you can make
                            sure you’re getting the most out of your day and rid yourself of unnecessary worry.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>This may sound crazy, but start by scheduling non-work time. After all, this is the time you
                            have the most control over and can mold it to suit your idea of a fulfilling day. Determine
                            how much sleep you need, what times you prefer to eat, and time for leisure activities.</p>

                        <p>In my final year of university, I came across an idea developed by a sleep consultant, Nick
                            Littlehales, explaining the importance of getting five 90-minute sleeps per night. This is
                            the sleep schedule used by star soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo. This adds up to seven and
                            a half hours of sleep nightly. Littlehales explains that human sleep operates in cycles and
                            at the end of a 90 minute cycle, the body wakes up feeling optimally refreshed [5].</p>

                        <p>I incorporated this into my routine during my previously mentioned exam period I’d prefer to
                            forget about but I keep coming back to as it’s the most stressful time for any student. With
                            two weeks off class to dedicate to studying for exams, I needed to find a way to get the
                            most out of revision while using time management to reduce stress. So I began sleeping
                            exactly seven and a half hours every night.</p>

                            before my sociology exam.</span>

                        <p>Despite what I claimed above, I had never been a morning person but this sleep schedule
                            completely changed that. I would wake up and get out of bed at my first alarm, feeling
                            refreshed and ready to hit the books. I would study from nine to six, with a one hour lunch
                            break, then go home to cook dinner and go to the gym nearby. Being well-rested and
                            physically active noticeably improved my ability to retain what I was learning and
                            regurgitate it once the time for exams came. It wasn’t that hard either, especially when it
                            became a habit.</p>

                        <p>According to a study by the European Journal of Psychology, it takes on average, 66 days to
                            properly form a habit. This isn’t a short period of time but it is also very achievable [6].
                            If I can incorporate this habit even as a weak-minded student, then so can you.</p>

                        <p>I found the gym extremely important as an energy release to get me thoroughly exhausted
                            before bed and sleep like a rock. After a day of writing out econometric proofs, my body was
                            desperate to move around a little. If I did not do this, I would consistently find myself
                            pacing and hopping around my apartment late at night, much to the chagrin of my downstairs
                            neighbors, I’m sure. There’s people who will tell you to exercise in the morning. I say do
                            whatever works for you, just schedule it to reduce your stress.</p>

                        <p>Having a set time for food is also important. Eating to a schedule that your digestive system
                            is comfortable with allows for proper digestion and consistent energy levels throughout the
                            day [7]. Personally, I prefer to eat two meals per day between the hours of 12 and 8pm,
                            sometimes with a cheeky snack in between to keep energy levels high (see I do have a wild
                            side). I have come to find out that this is known as intermittent fasting and it is a
                            strategy that many fitness experts have used for a long time. Am I a nutrition science
                            innovator or just poor? You’ll never know.</p>

                        <p>Terry Crews, aka Sergeant Jeffords from Brooklyn Nine Nine and tough guy from those terrible
                            Expendables movies, has used a scheduled intermittent fasting method for the better part of
                            a decade [8]. If that guy does it and is that jacked in his early 50’s, there must be some
                            merit here surely.</p>

                        <p>Essentially, consistency is key when it comes to maintaining high energy levels throughout
                            the day. And only a schedule will keep you on track and reduce your stress at the same time.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to use tech to time-block with ease</h2>

                        <p>Time blocking makes building a routine you can stick to easy. You can’t expect yourself to
                            just remember all the times you’re supposed to do certain activities! Technology is here to
                            help.</p>

                        <p>There are many online tools available to assist with time blocking. Some of the most popular
                            include, Plan, HourStack, Planyway, TickTick, and SkedPal. Of course, all online calendars
                            can be used for time blocking - these specialized tools just make it easier.</p>

                        <p>HourStack is probably the most novel of these tools, as it allows you to set timers and track
                            how long you spend on certain tasks without ever leaving the app. However, like the other
                            apps I have mentioned, you will have to sign up for a fairly pricey monthly plan to get the
                            most out of them.</p>

                        <p>If you don’t feel like allocating part of your budget to calendar extensions (that has to be
                            a new category on anyone’s budget planner!), I would recommend using <a

                            manner is detrimental to time blocking because not everyone will see your work choices as
                            valid and will try to steal the time you’ve allocated for the activities they believe are
                            most important.</p>

                        <p>This way no one will be able to see that your scheduled hour for “deep work” is the reason

                            are for secretly streaming the footy at your desk. Sometimes it’s best to keep some things
